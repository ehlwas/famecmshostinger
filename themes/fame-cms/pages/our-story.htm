                    <p class="paragraph">F.A.M.E. which represents fashion, art, music & entertainment, is an annual stage show that was launched as a means of encouraging integration and providing a platform for people of determination to showcase their talents.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Using these four channels, F.A.M.E. acts include a fashion show, musical and dance performances and dramatic acts. Over the years the show has become the UAEâ€™s biggest inclusive event and each year grows in participants and creativity. New participants are encouraged to the stage each year as we develop the show content.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">With the growing interest in the annual F.A.M.E. production, we are pleased to be launching the F.A.M.E. TALENT HUB. A place where children and youths from the community can sign up to a variety of recreational classes and enjoy all that the Talent Hub has to offer.</p>
